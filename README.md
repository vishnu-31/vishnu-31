<summary><h3> My Coding Journey</h3></summary>

- I have been coding since High school on computer science exercises. I got into a CS because I liked the concept of programming. But I really started to play with code on my 3rd Year of College.
- I have working knowledge on Java, HTML, CSS, Javascript because they were introduced in the curriculum and I did some projects using them.
- Now I am a focused on Python and did some cool projects with it.
- I had a programming buddy who shared the same interest as mine during the COVID-19 Pandemic. So, we did small projects which increased my curiosity on programming.
- Now I am a Data Scientist in a company on my Locality.
- I am a  <img align="left" alt="Linux" width="10px" style="padding-right:5px;" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/linux/linux-original.svg" /> Linux Enthusiast.
